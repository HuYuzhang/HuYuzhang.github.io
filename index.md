Hi, I'm Hu Yuzhang. I am currently pursuing a Master degree at Peking University, advised by Prof. Jiaying Liu.
My research interests include video compression and image enhancement.
I am also interested in football, cycling, hiking, mystery novels, geography, and the history of ancient East Asia.

So that's all about my research. What I want to show next is how I enjoy the world.

### About Travel

![Image](images/map-220315.png)
Each time I go to a new place, I will mark it in the Google Map (updating...). These are the cities where I have left my footprints up to now.
Many of these memories still impress me even today. I have set myself a few goals driven by my ambition to explore the world.

1. Travel all the provinces in China before 2028.
2. Travel to 10 countries in Aisa before 2038.
3. Travel to all continents except Antarctica before 2048.

### About Photograph
During my journey, I will always take many photos, and the pleasant flavor of these experiences can be recollected with them.
I do not have advanced equipment like SLR camera so I just use my mobile phone. I'm glad to share the stories behind these photos If you like some of them.

### About My Bike

I have a cool bike: Giant XTC 800. I ride to school every day by it. During weekends, it becomes my partner to explore this city. It is equipped with SHIMANO Deore and SHIMANO BL-MT200, which provides wonderful reliability and performance. The destinations include the Greate Wall, the West Mountain, the Tanzhe Temple, and the Xinshougang Bridge, *etc.*. Here are some photos of it.

### About Reading
During my senior middle school time, I have little time to go out and it seems that life is filled with finishing exercises after classes
and preparing for exams. At that time, I tried to develop the habit of reading when I am frustrated by endless exercises and exams. 
After entering college, I began to use Douban, where everyone can share their opinions of books and films and even games with each other. Here is [My Douban](https://www.douban.com/people/175875998/).
I want to share some books that I like most.
