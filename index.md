Hi, I'm Hu Yuzhang. I am currently pursuing a Master degree at Peking University, advised by Prof. Jiaying Liu.
My research interests include video compression and image enhancement.
I am also interested in football, cycling, badminton, hiking, mystery novels, geography, and the history of ancient East Asia.
You can contact me by mail: yuzhanghu@pku.edu.cn
