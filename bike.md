I have a cool bike: Giant XTC 800. I ride to school every day by it. During weekends, it becomes my partner to explore this city. It is equipped with SHIMANO Deore and SHIMANO BL-MT200, which provides wonderful reliability and performance. The destinations include the Greate Wall, the West Mountain, the Tanzhe Temple, and the Xinshougang Bridge, *etc.*. Here are some photos of it.

### Friends of My Bike
My bike is so lucky that it has some bike-friends, which makes all journeys warm and filled with happiness. I want to represent my bike to thank them all here. Namely, acknowledgment :)
