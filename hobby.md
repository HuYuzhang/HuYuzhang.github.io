### Reading
During my senior middle school time, I have little time to go out and it seems that life is filled with finishing exercises after classes
and preparing for exams. At that time, I tried to develop the habit of reading when I am frustrated by endless exercises and exams. 
After entering college, I began to use Douban, where everyone can share their opinions of books and films and even games with each other. Here is [My Douban](https://www.douban.com/people/175875998/).
I want to share some books that I like most.

                <img src="images/bk2.jpg" width = "230">
                <img src="images/bk3.jpg" width = "230">
                <img src="images/bk8.jpg" height= "325" width = "230">
                <img src="images/bk9.jpg" height= "327" width = "230">
                <img src="images/bk6.jpg" width = "230">

### Game
I like games. Some are my partners to accompany me when I am lonely during my childhood. Some can broaden my scope by experiencing a different life.
Some teach me lots of historical and geographic knowledge, and even driving me to learn a foreign language.
They deserve the praise as "the ninth category of art".
I want to share some games that have great impact on my life.
